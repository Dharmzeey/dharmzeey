            A self taught django full stack developer with over 3 years
            experience in web and mobile development.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a python programmer, most of my projects are built on Django
            which I sometimes use tailwind, django-allauth and some other
            frameworks and libraries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also a flutter developer with a passion for crafting seamless
            cross-platform experiences, I bring over 2 years of self-taught
            expertise in Flutter development to the table. Proficient in
            building mobile applications that blend functionality and
            aesthetics, my skills in Flutter complement my Django full stack
            capabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            From solo ventures to collaborative projects, my diverse portfolio
            showcases the versatility and innovation I bring to the world of web
            and mobile development.

            Hardware Engineering is also one of my favourite, being able to
            think of something to bring the idea to life and solving a problem
            or bringing revolution to how things are being done. Sooner or later
            I will upgrade and incoporate my software skill into building
            physical things.
