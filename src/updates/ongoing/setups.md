This project was inspired through analysis of the financial market

Whenever I finish analysis of the an asset and I have gotten my bias and reason for that analysis, I always want to go back and re-study why I had that analysis and why the trade goes well or not.

So I built this as a way to keep all my setups and analysis for later use, and also as a form of journalling

* Homepage just shows the recent analysis I uploaded

## **Homepage**

+ Create and update page does the work of creating or updating analysis as the name implies.
