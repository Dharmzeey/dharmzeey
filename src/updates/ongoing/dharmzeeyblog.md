This is one of few projects I just built just for practicing.

It is more of an online diary and a personal daily update and not that of a **BLOG**, I built this so that anywere I am and not with a my physical diary, I can always update my daily or any special activities. 

This is a personal blog so I did not give room for account creation and logging in, but visitors can view the blogs and pass comments if the wish.
