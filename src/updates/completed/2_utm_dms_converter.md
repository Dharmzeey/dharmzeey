# UTM DMS Converter

The **UTM DMS Converter** is a lightweight web application designed to help users convert **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)** coordinates into more readable formats such as:

- 🧭 **Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS)**
- 🌍 **Latitude & Longitude (Decimal Degrees)**

This tool is ideal for GIS professionals, engineers, surveyors, and students working with spatial data who need fast, accurate coordinate conversion without external dependencies.

---

## 🖥️ Overview

Built using **Flask** for the backend and **vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend, the app provides a clean, responsive interface focused on usability and simplicity. It runs efficiently on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. UTM to DMS Conversion  
Easily convert UTM coordinates into traditional **Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds** format.

### 2. UTM to Latitude/Longitude Conversion  
Convert UTM values into **decimal latitude and longitude** for use in GPS tools and mapping software.

### 3. Responsive Design  
The UI adapts seamlessly across screen sizes, making it usable on phones, tablets, and desktops.

## 🛠️ Frameworks and Libraries

- **Backend**: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)  – Lightweight Python web framework
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – No third-party libraries used
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, Render, or Vercel (with appropriate backend support)

---

## 💡 How It Works

Users input the following:
- **Easting** (X-coordinate in meters)
- **Northing** (Y-coordinate in meters)
- **Zone Longitude** (e.g., Zone 32N)

The app then performs the conversion and displays the result instantly.

## 📚 What is Easting and Northing?

**Easting** and **Northing** are components of the UTM coordinate system:

| Term     | Direction | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Easting** | East-West | Distance east from the central meridian (in meters), with a false easting of 500,000 m added to avoid negatives |
| **Northing** | North-South | Distance north from the equator (in meters); in the southern hemisphere, a false northing of 10,000,000 m is added |

Most GPS devices or GIS software will provide these values directly.
