summary: ABUAD Farm is a web application built using Django and Django template, designed to mock a manufacturing company need. It also features vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The application provides role-based access control, offering distinct functionalities for Admins, Staff, and Users. Admins have full control over the system, including managing units, customers, and messages through the Django Admin Panel. Staff members have limited access, focusing on unit-specific data and customer interactions, while Users can access personal dashboards, notifications, and purchase history. The platform includes various pages such as a Home Page, Units Page, About Page, Blog Page, and dashboards with intuitive chart. Technologies like Django-Allauth, AmCharts JS, and Tailwind CSS are utilized, with charts powered by AmCharts JS. Demo credentials are available for testing the User Panel.

# ABUAD Farm

The Idea is as a result of where I was posted to do my IT, so the organization is a Farm and also a manufacturing company, they make different products from their farm produce.

They have different units and they produce different products at each units I then decided to build something channeling my focus to the mode of operation.

I designed this web Application on the foundation of a Manufacturing Company.
It is a Django Project, which I also used djangorestframework for some serialization.
I used vanilla Js and Tailwind CSS(django-tailwind)
Django-Allauth was used for the authentication 

It has different Apps that handled different functionalities

# ADMIN
**The Admin is a Django superuser who has full access to the Django Admin Panel and also to all the units and products and all customers both in the Django Admin Panel and the other Admin Page** 
## The Admin can:
- Can view all the Units.
- Can view all the customers on the Database, regardless of the unit they have made purchase from

## **Staff Homepage**
- These are the users that have been assigned to each units in the company 
### Their Staffs status was created by the superuser (Admin) in the Admin panel 
## Staffs Can:
- View all the customers that made purchase from their units 
- Send message to each customers who has made purchase from their units 
- Add customers product purchase for each customer who made purchase from their units 

# USERS

**Customers only have access to their accounts alone(which contains all the units they made purchases)**
**All accounts created have user and  profiles model**
**But they are later given different statuses**
- Users are customers who created account and made purchase from any unit 
## Users can:
- Have access to their Dashboard, Messages, Notifications and Profiles
