summary: The CTM API is a subscription-based e-commerce platform built using Django and Django Rest Framework. It is designed to support both web and mobile applications. The platform allows vendors to create location-based stores where they can upload and sell products. The number of products a vendor can upload and their visibility to users depends on the vendor's subscription status, which can be active or inactive, and also differing plans. For regular users who are not vendors, the platform offers the ability to explore the site either anonymously or as logged-in users. They can browse products, select items of interest, and proceed with transactions directly with vendors.
